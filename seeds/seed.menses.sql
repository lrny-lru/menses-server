  ('General information on PMDD',

  'PMDD is a unique cyclic mood disorder. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe mood disorder, unique in that symptoms come and then go with the hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle. Symptoms emerge monthly in the luteal phase, roughly one to two weeks (or 12-14 days) before you start your period, when sex steroid hormones are fluctuating. Symptoms quickly leave in the hormonally stable follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, the roughly two weeks between menses and ovulation. Symptoms then return with the following menstrual cycles luteal phase. 
  
  Characteristic PMDD symptoms include emotional dysregulation (or basically your emotions are strong and bounce around quickly), irritability (becoming very angry quickly and intensely over usually minor issues or situations), anhedonia (depression where nothing you usually likes gives you pleasure, but instead annoys you), anxiety, as well as decreased interest in usual activities, poor concentration, being very sleepy, change in appetite (eating a lot more or a lot less than usual), sleep changes, feeling overwhelmed for no apparent reason, worsening of present mental disorders such as ADHD, and physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, bloating, headaches joint pains . The monthly waxing and waning of these symptoms produces distress and functional impairment totaling 24 days to up to 6 months annually.
  
   Across the roughly 450 menstrual cycles that a person has in their lifetime, an individual who experiences PMDD symptoms for one week per cycle would experience 8.6 cumulative years of symptoms, similar to what someone with recurrent major depressive disorder would experience across their lifetime. PMDD affects three to eight percent of people worldwide, roughly similar to the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder.',

  (' Definition of Endometriosis',

    'Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrium in an abnormal or ectopic location. Histologically, it is the presence of endometrial-like tissue or glands outside the uterine cavity. In everyday words, it means there is muscle tissue that usually grows on the inside of the uterus growing on the outside of it. Since this is tissue that helps facilitate pregnancy, this can be a painful thing.  It is a gynecological disorder dependent on hormones observed most commonly in reproductively active women . The ectopic endometrial tissue responds to hormonal stimulation and undergoes cyclic growth and shedding. Without a way to drain, this causes internal accumulation of blood. Endometriosis is associated often with dyspareunia (vaginal pain during sex), cyclic menstrual pain, and pelvic pain [4]. These painful episodes can have a negative effect on the quality of life of patients with this condition experience.',

    'Hormones',
    'Hormones are chemical text messages that can be created and sent through out the body as a way to adjust to environmental situations but also as part of cylical phases like the menstrual cycle. The main take away here is that there are water-soluble and fat-soluble hormones. Many of the hormones involved in the menstrual cycle are fat-soluble hormones. Fat-soluble hormones stay in your body longer than water-soluble hormones, which is why individuals can experience drastic mood and behavior changes during their menstrual cycle. ',
